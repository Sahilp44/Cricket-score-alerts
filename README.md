Cricket fans, raise your foam fingers if you have been looking for a quicker way to share scores 
and updates with your friends. Even if you arenâ€™t a sports enthusiast, think about the number 
of fans who are out there looking for an option like this on their phones. Sports websites do 
offer live scores on their page which is what the majority of the people follow to stay updated 
on live updates if they are not watching a match. But the thing with these websites is that you 
have to keep staring at the page or refreshing it to get the latest score which can be quite 
unproductive if you are in the middle of important work. Moreover, every time you want to 
check the score of your favorite team and if you want to enjoy the special events like SIX, 
FOUR and OUT, you have to manually share it via a messaging app. But now, we had made a 
better solution for the millions of sports fans.
